# Emotion Classifier App

This repository contains an **Emotion Classifier App** built with **Streamlit** and **Scikit-Learn**. The app classifies user-entered text into predefined emotions, leveraging a machine learning model for emotion detection. It includes a streamlined interface for prediction, monitoring, and viewing probability distributions of emotions.

## Features

- **Text-based Emotion Classification**: Detects emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, etc., from user-input text.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays predictions and associated probabilities with emoji representations.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes prediction probabilities using bar charts in the app.
  
## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/emotion-classifier-app.git
   cd emotion-classifier-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Model**:
   Ensure the pre-trained model `emotion_classifier.pkl` is available in the `models/` directory.

## Usage

To start the app, run:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Repository Structure

| File/Folder           | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `app.py`              | Main application script for Streamlit that handles UI and prediction functions.               |
| `data/`               | Contains the emotion dataset used for training (`emotion_dataset_2.csv`).                     |
| `models/`             | Contains the pre-trained model `emotion_classifier.pkl`.                                      |
| `requirements.txt`    | Lists the required packages and dependencies for the app.                                     |

## Components Overview

### 1. `app.py` - Main App Code
   - **Core Packages**: `streamlit`, `altair` for building and visualizing the web app.
   - **EDA Packages**: `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation and processing.
   - **Utils**: `joblib` for loading the pre-trained model.
   - **UI**:
     - **Home**: Allows text input and displays emotion prediction and probabilities.
     - **Monitor**: Placeholder for future monitoring and analytics.
     - **About**: Information about the app.
   - **Functions**:
     - `predict_emotions`: Predicts the main emotion for a given text.
     - `get_prediction`: Returns probabilities for each emotion.

### 2. `emotion_classifier.pkl` - Trained Model Pipeline
   - Built using **Logistic Regression** and **CountVectorizer**.
   - Trained on a labeled dataset of emotions to classify text into 8 categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, shame, and surprise.

### 3. `emotion_dataset_2.csv` - Training Dataset
   - Dataset used to train the emotion classification model, preprocessed using `neattext` for cleaning (e.g., removing user handles and stopwords).

### 4. Model Training Code
   - **Pipeline**: Defined in `app.py` (not part of the Streamlit app), which uses `CountVectorizer` for text transformation and `LogisticRegression` for prediction.
   - **Training and Saving**: The pipeline is trained and saved using `joblib`.

## Future Improvements

- Add additional emotions and expand training data for better accuracy.
- Develop the "Monitor" section to provide insights on prediction trends.
